                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a young age, a technical career seemed inevitable for me. My dad started his career as a freelance junior programmer and 
                    eventually moved from Canada to the States as an IT Security Engineer at Boeing. From creating and editing scripts in online games, to tinkering with Raspberry Pi
                    and Android devices and learning Linux terminal, I dabbled in any technical project growing up.<br> 
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The summer of my senior year of high school, I took a summer intro to coding course at DigiPen Institute of Technology. 
                    There, I would learn C and created my own first personal project of a terminal based Connect 4 game. With the infinite challenges that programming presented,
                    I knew immediately after that I wanted to be a software engineer. I would move on to take an AP Computer Science course in school that taught me Java fundamentals,
                    and ultimately, gave me the skills to land an internship at Microsoft. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Microsoft was my first view at what a career in software engineering would look like for me. It was challenging, 
                    and through my project on the Azure team, I learned PowerShell scripting, C#, .NET, and HTML. The collaborative, team based environment really shaped
                    my whole view on the corporate tech world, and inspired me to keep pushing towards my career. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the next few years I would work a few jobs to help pay bills while pursuing self-study in programming 
                    and taking a few college computer science courses. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eventually, in 2022, I ended up onsite at Nintendo as a junior debug tester for their games. I wanted a job that would allow me
                    to apply the problem-solving skills I had been honing for years in a collaborative environment. I got to work on three of the biggest game projects 
                    for the Nintendo Switch that year. There were quite a few challenging bugs that required a lot of time to reproduce, one even taking a few days! 
                    Almost every day was a joy, but I knew that I ultimately wanted a software engineer position. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I left Nintendo at the end of 2022, and for the next few months, I would research apprenticeships and programs until I ultimately landed
                    on FastTrack, which seemed like the perfect program to advance my career. We have learned Java, Spring Boot, and JavaScript, and are currently 
                    in an Angular module. At the same time, I also work at Amazon as a delivery driver. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside of work, I actively compete in Super Smash Bros Ultimate tournaments and enjoy men's fashion, playing piano, and singing.
